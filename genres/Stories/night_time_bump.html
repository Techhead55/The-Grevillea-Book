There we were. After what seemed like forever, we were a block away from home. We had been trick or treating, and I was exhausted.  I was assisting my little brother on his first Halloween and showing him a few tricks on getting the maximum candy load. The regret that I came to support him was strong. For the past two hours, I have been trying to keep up to him, as the excitement he felt made him scuttle to the next house in a matter of seconds. Finally, we reached the familiar sight of our front door.  But wait… glued to the door lay a piece of paper. A note, possibly? I grabbed it, and scripted on to the paper was the handwriting of my mum.<i><div id="spacer"></div>
“Boys,
Don't try to find out where we have gone, please.                                                                                            This is serious. Take care of Timmy, and don't try to find us.                                                                       DON'T GO UPSTAIRS.
Love, Mum and Dad”</i>

This is odd indeed. What has happened? I attempted to turn the door knob but of course, it was locked. I guided my brother around to the backyard and tried the back door. It was wide open already. The lights were out and we could only hear what sounded like a bump from upstairs. This startled us and we both stood still and listened intently. The light upstairs was flickering turning on and off rapidly. After a minute or two, the noise and light stopped abruptly. We quietly snuck inside. Instinctively, I flicked the light switch, but, the power was out. Timmy started to whimper as the bumping and flickering started again a minute later. I decided I had to go upstairs to calm Timmy down and to find out what was creating this noise. <div id="spacer"></div>
As I placed my foot on the first step a loud creak sounded. I thought it was because it was an old house and I had stepped on a loose floorboard, but no, it was coming from upstairs, growing louder and louder as I got closer and closer. The top floor in our house was almost pitch black and I moved around using my memory of the place. I remembered there was a flashlight in Timmy's room in case the lights went out. So down the hallway I went, feeling the walls of the hallway waiting for the second door on the left. Once I’d reached there, I immediately felt the pain in my feet caused by discarded Lego. Timmy had been given a Lego monster hunting kit just a day before... I then thought about the noises, and intuitively turned around just to make sure nothing was there. I turned back around and felt around for the flashlight, my fingers were brushing the top of the drawers, not there. On the floor amongst the Lego was where I found it. <div id="spacer"></div>
I turned it on and turned around and jumped half a mile, there stood Timmy looking pale with fright. He was obviously scared of being alone, then, the bumps sounded again. Timmy ran like a bolt of lightning to me and held me tight. It seemed to be coming from the attic.  I walked over to the doorway and pointed the flashlight around to find the attic door; I decided to continue down the hallway, following the noise. It just kept on going, and I didn't want to find out what was up there. <div id="spacer"></div>
I could only hear a “THUMP, THUMP, THUMP” and soon we came to the handle to open the way to the attic. My heart was beating so hard, I thought Timmy could hear it. I slowly moved my hand towards the handle and pulled it down. It was creaking and the noises seemed to stop. I walked up the stairs and saw... well... monsters, dancing. The bump must have been the sound of the bass, but as I got closer I noticed they were people in costumes? Mum was there as vampire, Dad was a werewolf and Uncle Frank was a skeleton, and some other people, most likely friends of my parents. It seems like most of the adults in our street were there. Mum and Dad did not look impressed. <div id="spacer"></div>
<i>“We told you guys not to come up here! We never get time without you kids!” Dad was yelling. </i><div id="spacer"></div>
This Halloween had so far been the most weird and scary ever, but it hadn't finished yet. From outside the window there was a face looking in, it was a pale and white, a face I remember, but I cannot remember when and what. The eyes were just a ball of white, and I cannot see a nose. Then…
