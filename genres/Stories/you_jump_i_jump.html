I heaved myself off the ageing bus before nodding my head in thanks towards the driver. My eyes followed the back of the bus as it rattled over a small hill in the distance, leaving me alone with my thoughts. The rough sea winds nipped at my exposed skin as I walked towards the edge of the cliff face. I walked pass a sign reading Slieve League Cliff, Ireland. <div id="spacer"></div>
I smiled wearily to myself as I ran my fragile fingers across the many scars that had been carved into my wrists from years of self-harming. Some were recent whilst others were ancient things. I had similar prominent markings lacing a large percentage of my body; I was tattooed with designs which never failed to remind me of the reality of my past and the pain of the present. <div id="spacer"></div>
As I edger closer towards the edge of the cliff face which overlooked the waves battling in the ocean waters, I scanned my surrounding in order to make sure that I indeed was alone. As my eyes whipped around the views that enclosed me, I glimpsed up at the sun and saw that it nibbling on the clouds, meaning a storm was brewing. I ignored those signs and continued looking around when a figure in the distance caught my eye. I squinted at it, trying to get a better look and it soon came to my attention that the "figure" was in fact a young male. A sudden rush of fear surged through my veins as five words became all too clear to me. He was going to jump. <div id="spacer"></div>
Before I could register my own actions, my legs rushed my over towards the mystery person. After half a minute or so running, I slowly came to a halt, realising that it"d be best to cautiously creep closer to him, in oppose to rushing towards his presence and then scaring him into doing something drastic. I was no more than ten meters away from him when he finally turned his head over towards me. I was quick to take in his beautiful features; his dark green sweater complemented his green orbs, which were tinged with red, most likely due to hours of crying. He stood tall and broad and I could bet that if I lifted a sleeve, there would be cuts. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Go away! What are you even doing?" He yelled at me over the wind. <div id="spacer"></div>
"I could ask you the same thing," I shot back as I slowly took my position next to him. <div id="spacer"></div>
"You know what my plan is," he mumbled whilst bringing his eyes from my face down to the sea which roared below us, most likely debating whether to jump now or in a few minutes. I chewed harshly at my bottom lip, unphased by the tangy taste of blood that invaded my mouth before reigniting the conversation. <div id="spacer"></div>
"I was in your position exactly a year ago, I was about to jump from right over there" I admitted shamefully whilst pointing to the spot which was located a few hundred metres away from us. "That"s why I came here today; it"s the anniversary of me nearly jumping. Figured it was something worth celebrating, ya know?" <div id="spacer"></div>
"So what's changed?" He asked quietly before entangled his fingers with mine. I was taken aback at first, but was quick to squeeze his hand in reassurance. "Did anything get better?" <div id="spacer"></div>
"Yeah, I mean I went to a psych ward. I was there for, like, three months. The road to recovering was rough, but I'm stronger now. And if you take a few steps back from the edge and go and find someone to help you, then you"ll be stronger too." <div id="spacer"></div>
"What if I don't want to be stronger?" He spat before viciously ripping his hand from my grasp. Venom dripped form his voice and I failed to comprehend how his opinion, tone and character could all change in just a matter of seconds. "You can't stop me from jumping. No one can." <div id="spacer"></div>
Those words sent me into a state of panic. I struggled to regulate my breathing pattern as I frantically raked through my mind; attempting to find a way to stop his from ending his life. Then it hit me. <div id="spacer"></div>
"You're right," I shrugged before bringing my hands up to his face and turning it towards me. "But that means you can't stop me from jumping after you." <div id="spacer"></div>
He opened his mouth to protest, but nothing came out. He simply shook his head, obviously not trusting his own voice. I once again laced our fingers together as I pressed a light kiss to his tear stained cheek. <div id="spacer"></div>
"You jump, I jump, Rose." I winked as I watched a flicker of a smile flash across his face at my Titanic reference. He hesitantly took a step back, bringing me with him. I jerked my head towards a bench which sat an innocent distance away from ledge, signalling that we should go and sit down. He froze for a second, but which a gentle tug on my behalf, he moved with me to the safety of the bench. <div id="spacer"></div>
Once we both reached our desired destination, he was quick to envelope me in a warm embrace. As our limbs entwined with one another on the bench and he rested his chin on my head. After what felt like hours of soothing silence, a wave of guilt washed over me and my breath hitched in my throat. I had lied to this beautiful boy, and he didn"t even know it. <div id="spacer"></div>
I didn"t get better. I wasn"t stronger. I didn"t go to a physch ward. And I wasn"t here to celebrate not jumping. <div id="spacer"></div>
I was here to kill my demons by killing myself. <div id="spacer"></div>
Tears pooled in my eyes. The voice in my head refused to be silenced. Both my scars and current cuts began to tingle. My head started throbbing. I needed to jump. <div id="spacer"></div>
It was obvious that I had to find a way to either distract this boy or get him to leave so I could do the deed. I rummage through the thoughts which overflowed my mind, hoping to find a solution to my predicament, and thankfully, I prevailed. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Maybe you should call your family, let "em know that ya fine and stuff," I suggested, silently praying that my distraction would work. "There"s a phone booth over there and I"ve got some change in my pockets." <div id="spacer"></div>
He remained silent. I cussed under my breath as I realised that this wasn"t going to work. <div id="spacer"></div>
Of course he wouldn"t do that, what was I thinki- <div id="spacer"></div>
"I won"t be more than a couple of minutes," he informed me before untangling himself from my warmth. He held out his hand and I quickly replaced its emptiness with a couple of coins. "I"m Edward by the way." <div id="spacer"></div>
"I"m Ella." <div id="spacer"></div>
He flashed a small smile before walking over to a phone booth which sat in isolation a few meters away. I watched him from the comfort of the bench, and made sure that he had been sucked into the conversation he was having over the phone before rushing over to the cliff edge. <div id="spacer"></div>
Once I was there, I took a deep breath before closing my eyes. I slowly shuffled forward, but then staggered back when I felt someone grasp my hand. My eyes shot open and I was greeted by an emotionless set of eyes. <div id="spacer"></div>
"What are you doing?" I questioned at a volume that was higher than necessary. Edward just tightened the grip he had on my hand in response before letting tears fall from his eyes. "Well then?" <div id="spacer"></div>
"Mum said she didn"t want someone like me living under her roof. She said it"d be better for everyone if I just committed. And like you said earlier, you jump--" <div id="spacer"></div>
"I jump," I interjected. He brought my hand up to his mouth a pressed a light kiss to it before sighing heavily. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Ready?" <div id="spacer"></div>
"Ready." <div id="spacer"></div>
The wind whispered a single word into our ears. Jump. <div id="spacer"></div>
So we did. <div id="spacer"></div>
