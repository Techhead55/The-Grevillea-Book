				<i>This story is written by Baha'a, who has only been in Australia for six months.</i>
                <div id="spacer"></div>
Once upon a time, there was a King. His name was Arthur, and he had a faithful guard whose name was Jerry. He believed in destiny and everything in life was meant to be.<div id="spacer"></div>
      One day, King Arthur went to a battle with an enemy that caused him a serious injury in his leg and made him crippled, (like a lion that can't eat his prey). When King Arthur returned back to his castle he was extremely angry and complained about his injury, how painful and swollen it was. His guard, Jerry, looked at him and asked him politely to stop complaining. Jerry told him that this injury was good for him and "perhaps for the best". King Arthur was angry at him and put him in prison; Jerry was patient and understood the King's reaction. One month later, a big scar had formed on the site of the injury. <div id="spacer"></div>
      King Arthur went with his guards to hunt in the middle of the forest. He enjoyed catching wild animals, such as lions, to use their skin and fur as clothing for himself. While they were in the middle of the forest, they could not find the way back to the castle. <div id="spacer"></div>
      Suddenly, a group of eight, strong men attacked them and took them to their village. These villagers believed in a God who had superior power. Every six months they had to sacrifice a perfect human body to ask for mercy and answer their prayers. <div id="spacer"></div>
      After checking the hostages, they found a huge scar on King Arthur's leg, which made him an imperfect victim, while the other eight sloggers where perfect victims to be sacrificed in the future. At this moment King Arthur remembered what his faithful guard Jerry told him. This was a reason to release him back to the forest.<div id="spacer"></div>
      King Arthur was tired, hungry and cold in the forest. Fortunately, he found the way back to the castle. As soon as he arrived at the castle he ordered to release his guard, Jerry, from prison.<div id="spacer"></div>
      King Arthur apologised and told him about what had happened to him and his guards. The scar had saved his life. He told him how right he was when he said, "perhaps for the best".
