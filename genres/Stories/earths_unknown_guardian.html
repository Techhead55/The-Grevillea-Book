I am always in the corner of your eye. Look closely. You know I am here, yet you tell yourself over and over that I do not exist until you believe it. I am a result of society and the real world as you know it. I may look like the other seven billion people on this world that I walk amongst every day, yet I am different. This is my story. <div id="spacer"></div>
As a child I was different from the others. Different, not by my appearance, attitude or behaviour. Different as in I could see what others couldn’t. The things others perceived as non-existent, imaginary or fake. But they were wrong, oh so wrong. <div id="spacer"></div>
If only the others could have seen what I could this wouldn’t have happened.  Society, what really is it? A label that someone once put on a group of people living together in a more or less ordered community, that just stuck.  You would think that having over seven billion people live on this over populated planet would make it a society but it is nowhere near. <div id="spacer"></div>
Seven billion people all fighting each other at once, yet they don’t even know it. <div id="spacer"></div>
In my teenage years the images in my head became more and more real, but still nobody else noticed them. How could they not see? This made me angry, so angry that it was time others knew. It was time they stopped over looking these things, forcing themselves to believe they were imaginary and forgetting they existed. <div id="spacer"></div>
But this only got me into trouble. “You’re insane”, “Freak”, “Go back to the mental ward”, Were just some of the abuse the ‘normal’ people would yell back at me. This was not acceptable. <div id="spacer"></div>
Wounded and hurt by the people I once tried to help. They were all so blind but it was not their fault. Humanity had put them under her dreadful curse. Strictly left to believe the same things as each other and that small percentage, my percentage were left to become outcasts. <div id="spacer"></div>
I couldn’t let this happen. So I became one of them. Not one of the ones labelled normal but one of those who I could see. One of the ones only the hopers and dreamers could see. One of the ones who were imaginary, non-existent and impossible. One of the ones left to protect the others. <div id="spacer"></div>
Now I walk the earth in search of others who were once like myself.  The ones who can stop humanity before it’s too late. Although I am still marching a lost cause, the hope of finding just one special, unique person could change the world for better and that is why I am the unknown guardian.
