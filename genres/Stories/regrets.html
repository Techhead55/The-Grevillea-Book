Homeless, unemployed and alone. That's me, Evelyn Homewood. Dropped out of college a year ago, left the house three days later. I finally had enough. Living on the streets, watching people glare at you, pitying you, giving you their spare 5, 10 cents.  I knew that my only option was to go back. The thought of calling that place home, and those people my family frightened me. I needed to return, but no, I couldn't. The hurt, the pain, the abuse. The constant taunting, hitting and yelling. <div id="spacer"></div>
I picked up my suitcase, which was luckily still intact, and left my post of the last 12 months. The wander home didn't take too long. Living on the streets teaches you to walk fast in fear of rape or theft. I looked up of the clock on the community hall, two streets down from “that house”. Exactly 6:30pm. I had lived in that house long enough to know that dinner was ready. 6:31pm. He would then yell for me to set the table. The clock ticked. 6:32pm. He lifts up the girls and places them at the table. I stared at the clock with emotions of love, fear and hatred overwhelming me. Remembering years of such a surrounding, and all of a sudden leaving them was too emotionally painful. <div id="spacer"></div>
I stumbled onto the front porch. The scent, the feel was too familiar. I had to do it. I had to take Tori and Alexia away from that monster's arms. I clambered over the fence, avoiding the fear of being caught. I reminisced the times that that man and I spent together.  I knew he loved me, even though my young reckless teenage years. When those girls came along, it started. The thought of having to care for two more people in the family freaked him out. He started to come home drunk, hitting me, telling me that I was a useless fool. The pain drove me out of university, and the hope of have a brighter future, the hope of being able to not rely on my own income. The repetition of being told that that university was just a waste of his money and then forcing me out of the home was too emotionally exhausting. <div id="spacer"></div>
As I crept around the house waiting for him to go to bed, there was a sudden movement beneath the walls. The ear-piercing cry was so distinct. He has begun to abuse the twins. The same abuse I received for such a long time, they were getting. I knew how physically and mentally scarring it was. I could let them cop it. They were still young. Then eternal silence filled the area. <div id="spacer"></div>
I crept over to the Alexia and Tori's window. I remember when I hijacked the window lock just in case I ever felt the need to escape. Never in a million years did I think I would be entering through the exact window I left through a year ago. I had vowed to myself that I would never return. I slid my tiny frail body through the hole. The room was a mess. <div id="spacer"></div>
Their father accidentally made them, and now it seem like he wants to accidentally kill them. I snuck through the room careful to avoid the piles and piles of dirty laundry. Then I saw her. Their mother. She was staring right at me. That mother, who turned a blind eye to the abuse. That mother, who thought that his abuse was just a “phase.” That mother, who was stupid enough to love such a man. That mother, me.
