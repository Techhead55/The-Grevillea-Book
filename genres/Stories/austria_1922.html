				<i>This is a true story from my Nanna that I have written about</i>
                <div id="spacer"></div>
I was split from my family at birth and taken to the dreaded missionary in Salzburg. The mean lady told me I had a sister, my mother was dead and my dad was in jail. I spent the first six years of my life growing up in a mission speaking German. My diet consisted of bread and lentils which were burnt nearly to a crisp. I wasn't allowed to leave the mission. I was trapped. One day I decided to try to leave the mission; I was caught by the mean lady. That day I got the cane, I still have a mark now from that horrible cane.
<div id="spacer"></div>It was a cold winter morning when a strange lady with blonde hair and brown eyes told me that I was going to France. I had never been left the mission before, so I didn't know what to expect from them or what they expected from me. I packed my clothes and a few photos that I was given of my mum and dad. I slowly stumbled in the car and sat patiently for the long car ride to France.<div id="spacer"></div>
The car ride was strenuous; I slowly watched the world go by. I asked lots of questions about what my house would look like, what would my family look liked and were the nice. I was ignored. I never had someone in my life that was nice to me; I didn't have any friends that spoke my language so it was hard to communicate with them. Before I knew it I was there; it was a gorgeous home covered in a sheet of white snow. There was a luscious white garden at the front. I could smell food cooking from inside, Life is going to be so much better now. This is what I had dreamed a loving family and a house I could stay warm in for the winter and stay cool in for the summer. I would have some one who loved me.<div id="spacer"></div>
I opened the car door to see my new family smiling at me. They looked so nice; I grabbed my suitcase and headed over to my new family. I waved bye to the lady with the blonde hair who had given me to a wonderful family with an amazing home. I entered the house and sat down on the most comfortable couch I had every sat on (even though this is the only couch I had sat on before,). "Hello Miss Steggall" my mum said to me "we have to tell you a few rules number one you do as you're told and you must speak French!"<div id="spacer"></div>
"Mum I don't know French. I speak German and that's all I know how to do," I say respectfully.<div id="spacer"></div>
"You will learn off me until you can speak fluent French," she snapped at me. Luckily she was speaking in German so I knew what she was saying.<div id="spacer"></div>
Well this was not what I thought my new life would be.<div id="spacer"></div>






Years had passed and I was fluently speaking French I didn't think I could remember German anymore. My parents were really strict with me I don't know why, I tried to be good it but just ended up in no food for a week or a beating every weekend for a year. I decided it was best for me to move back to Salzburg, considering that I was turning 16 in a couple a days.<div id="spacer"></div>
I got a taxi to take me 500 miles back to that little missionary I grew up in. To my surprise it wasn't there, just some photos and paper scattered on top of a pile of rubble. The place looked as if it had been burnt down long ago. I picked up the things scattered on the rubble and looked at it. It had my name on it Isabelle. Why was my name on this? It had details about where my family was. Why wasn't I given this sooner? Thousands of questions were going through my head.<div id="spacer"></div>
I sat on the floor and read through the notes trying to read it. All of it was a blur. It was in German and my family made me speak French and I couldn't remember German anymore. I looked at it over and over again and no use I was stuck. The one thing that I could read was the country my sister was in. I could find her and we can live together and have a better life.<div id="spacer"></div>
'Barcelona, Spain'<div id="spacer"></div>
Great that's only 942 miles away, that's nothing I thought. This trip was longer than the other one I went on before to France. The scenery changed from the last time I travelled down this road. The snow was gone, instead there was beautiful green grass with animals and chirping birds. A day later of calm driving I found myself in the beautiful city of Barcelona. I had the documents with me and hadn't let them go. This was my way to a better future.<div id="spacer"></div>
I read the paper again and start to remember some of my German again. She lived in a mission in Barcelona. I walked up to the front desk and asked if I could see Natalie, who was a year older than me. Natalie came up to me and stared at me she looked exactly as me, same hair, same eyes. I told her that I was her sister and showed her the photo, she had the same photo it was given to her when we were split up.<div id="spacer"></div>
We left together to go to find a new place where we could live. We struggled though she spoke Spanish and I spoke French. While we travelled to Ukraine to seek refuge we taught each other German. Every day we spent teaching each other until we could finally speak fluent German again.
We didn't know anything about Ukraine; we needed to go as far away from Spain as we could. We crossed the border it was quiet. Too quiet. We heard gun fire. We heard screams. We were scared.  I told Natalie that it was alright I think we had found ourselves in the war. I was scared and I didn't know what to do. I found a little house near a river that had green vines tangled around it crawling up and down the worn out house. It was enough to stay for the night.<div id="spacer"></div>
BOOM!!! We heard bombs go off all night, screaming, and gun fire. I didn't get any sleep. Lucky Natalie did as she looked very tired from the trip. I was scared I didn't know why we picked this country anymore it was more like a death trap. The sun rose and we headed out to Italy.<div id="spacer"></div>
After another trip, Rome was a beautiful place with tall old buildings and friendly people. I didn't understand them but I didn't need to as long as I had my sister with me again and that is all I needed to be happy.
