The teen gazed silently outside the plane. <div id="spacer"></div>
The view reminded him of the war that lasted for five whole years. The current Japan had almost rebuilt all of its cities, although that doesn't include the historical sites that were destroyed during the war that almost purged all of the males in the world. <div id="spacer"></div>
He grits his teeth as he pushed away the memories that resurfaced on his mind. <div id="spacer"></div>
Despite being on his mid-teens, he carried burdens greater than others, although that story is for another time. <div id="spacer"></div>
Five years ago, his life ended and started at the same time. <div id="spacer"></div>
The 'Lost War' as it name implies, was a war that bought a downside on mankind. Because of this war, the population of men was nearly spent. Because of a mysterious disease that happen to spread. Because of the baseless rumour that males were the source of the so called virus. Because of that simple reason, the male gender was almost erased in the face of the planet. <div id="spacer"></div>
For five years, his gender was hunted because of false information. His friends and comrades were mercilessly killed by women and their cursed weapons called Infinite Stratos: An Exoskeleton suit that was originally designed for space explorations. It was modified by Professor Olivia Green and it became a weapon more advanced than any other weapon system. The machine that was viewed as the key to the future ironically doomed it. <div id="spacer"></div>
Because of this killing machine, women found themselves to be greater than men. Society changed accordingly and justice sided with them. Men were left and were treated like trash, eventually; they were treated as an abomination and were slaughtered. <div id="spacer"></div>
Young, old, weak or strong, they were killed without any second thoughts. <div id="spacer"></div>
Women ruled the world during those times, and his gender lived in fear. <div id="spacer"></div>
Five years of killing and relentless atrocity. He saw the world change with his very eyes. Countless innocent lives were taken and they were forced to live in a world of darkness, while their counterpart lived in luxury and power. <div id="spacer"></div>
It was only last year when the killings had stopped. <div id="spacer"></div>
They only considered researching the virus after four and a half years. Then it was proven, that the virus did not come from any of them. <div id="spacer"></div>
And was in fact, a chemical reaction from the nature itself after being exposed to nuclear and from some other factors. <div id="spacer"></div>
That was the time where the world discovered that they were killing people for no reason at all. Because they were corrupted by their newfound power, they had forgotten that men were people too. They had forgotten what equality means. <div id="spacer"></div>
But it was already too late. <div id="spacer"></div>
By this time, after five years of slaughter, the male population was almost gone. From 4 billion, their population were reduced into a mere 1 million. He could say that women were successful in their quest to destroy them. <div id="spacer"></div>
Because of that war, the trust of men towards women vanished, and their hatred made it worst. The remaining few of his gender decided to live secluded in a nation that forbids women from entering, while some decided to live in the environment that was provided by the government. Fewer of them decided to live normally in the society where women stand above men. <div id="spacer"></div>
Unfortunately, he was forced in the latter. <div id="spacer"></div>
Because of some reason, Zach Ivy, was discovered to be capable of using things that women used to kill countless people, the Infinite Stratos. <div id="spacer"></div>
I.S Academy was built in an artificial island connected only by a monorail. <div id="spacer"></div>
This place is where 1200 female students reside to learn how to pilot Infinite Stratos. I.S Academy is the most prestigious school in existence and all of its students â€“ from all over the world- were considered to be elite of the elites. <div id="spacer"></div>
This is the place where he would stay for three years. <div id="spacer"></div>
Zach boarded off the plane with a black backpack. Most of his items were already sent beforehand and his necessities will be provided by the government. He only needs to study here. The truth is that he had violently refused at first, but was forced anyway. <div id="spacer"></div>
Even though he knew that the government only wants to make the remaining males think there was still hope for equality, by using him, he wasn't really concerned. Because no matter what they do, as long as the Infinite Stratos exist, the world will never forget their atrocities. <div id="spacer"></div>
Because the I.S destroyed the future and the balance of nature itself. <div id="spacer"></div>
"It's been a while, you look different." <div id="spacer"></div>
Zach gritted his teeth as he heard the voice. <div id="spacer"></div>
The one who greeted him was the last person that he wanted to see in the world: his sister. <div id="spacer"></div>
"..."<div id="spacer"></div>
Zach only glared at his sister coldly, not bothering to grace her with a response. <div id="spacer"></div>
"We haven't seen nor talked to each other for five years, and this is how you greet me? Where's the smile and the annoying hug?" <div id="spacer"></div>
"..."<div id="spacer"></div>
His glare only intensified as he resisted the temptation to grab anything and use it to make a hole in her head. <div id="spacer"></div>
Because for him, he had no family. The one in front of him was the devil that killed him. She was an evil person that he had wanted to kill for so long. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Not talking, huh. If that's the case then let's get this started, I'm sure that my presence here only aggravates you." <div id="spacer"></div>
'I couldn't agree more,' he thought as he watched Sara walk. He followed her, although he was walking five metres behind her. The mere sight of her made his blood boil and his vision darken. <div id="spacer"></div>
"You are required to stay here and study for 3 years. Permission is needed if you want to go in the city. You are not allowed to leave the country. Everything that you need will be provided. Lastly, you are forbidden to use violence unless the situation calls for." <div id="spacer"></div>
"..."<div id="spacer"></div>
"Just like any other student here, you will need to study and pass every subjects. Is there any questions?" <div id="spacer"></div>
"..."<div id="spacer"></div>
"Your room will be located on the second floor of the first year dorm. You will share a room with a classmate whether you like it or not. I expect you to restrain yourself from doing anything violent. Even if you are the only male I.S pilot, that does not exempt you from the law." <div id="spacer"></div>
"..."<div id="spacer"></div>
Even though Zach did not respond, his footsteps carried more noise, indicating that he was not comfortable on the fact that he will share a room with a stranger, on top of that, a girl. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Your uniforms will be in your room, along with the manual." <div id="spacer"></div>
Sara stopped in her tracks as she stared at him, her expression unreadable as she eyed him from head to toe. <div id="spacer"></div>
"You really have changed, Zach," she muttered softly before she turned her back. "Your room is this way, your room mate is already there, follow me." <div id="spacer"></div>

The time was 1 am and his roommate was already asleep. Zach decided that he would want to see the layout of I.S Academy before he went to sleep. So without making even the slightest of noises, he left the room and silently walked in the dark corridor. <div id="spacer"></div>
There were still a few students awake and were doing things inside their dorms. <div id="spacer"></div>
Zach ignored most of them and only focused on the layout of the second floor. There were 20 rooms overall and the height from here will only give him some scratches should he jump. Not that something bad will happen, but it's better to be paranoid. <div id="spacer"></div>
Zach found the stairs and descended silently, he also counted the steps. Why was he doing that? Even he doesn't have the slightest idea. <div id="spacer"></div>
A few minutes later, Zach arrived outside of the first year dorm. <div id="spacer"></div>
The dorms were only 50 metres away from the building where the classrooms were located. It was 200 metres away from the large areas that he would guess as the arenas. Those structures were almost 500 metres wide and there were six of them here. I.S Academy sure is large. <div id="spacer"></div>
Zach stopped near a pond and took a sit in a nearby bench. He had a suspicion that someone was following him. <div id="spacer"></div>
True to his suspicion, he heard unrestrained footsteps approaching his way. <div id="spacer"></div>
"I knew you would sneak out here...brother." <div id="spacer"></div>
The voice that called him was happy and a hint of longing in it. Normally, Zach would ignore whoever the speaker was, but this time, he actually turned his gaze so that he could get a clear view of the person who approached him. <div id="spacer"></div>
"... Victoria" <div id="spacer"></div>
Unlike Sara, Zach still feels a little connection to this particular girl. Even though it's not as it used to be, it's enough so that he could speak to her. <div id="spacer"></div>
"I'm happy to see you brother... but it seems like you do not feel the same..."<div id="spacer"></div>
"..."<div id="spacer"></div>
Victoria walked even closer and stood in front of him. She stared at him for some good minutes before she sat beside him. Zach resisted the urge to distance himself. <div id="spacer"></div>
"... You've really changed brother." <div id="spacer"></div>
Although what she said was true, Zach wasn't proud of what he had become. He was a lot different now... his hands are simply stained by blood. <div id="spacer"></div>
"...It would be best if you don't talk to me again." <div id="spacer"></div>
Zach stood up after saying. Even though his resentment in his twin sister wasn't as hostile as Sara's, simply being with her fills him with bitter memories and excruciating pain. <div id="spacer"></div>
"I'm really happy to see you, brother" <div id="spacer"></div>
Without saying another word, Zach left. <div id="spacer"></div>
