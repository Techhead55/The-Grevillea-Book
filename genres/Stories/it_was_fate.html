<i>Amelia</i><div id="spacer"></div>
"Ooh, look what I got my hands on,” Reece exclaimed, gripping a fine bottle of Shiraz in one hand, accompanied by some rum infused chocolates in the other. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Pour me glass fine sir,” I responded wearily, trialling a posh accent in which I would likely never attempt again. <div id="spacer"></div>
I was seated on a cushioned chair, programming what ordinary civilians could only comprehend to be gibberish. However this nonsense was not for constructing a complex layout for a blog on the internet, what I haven’t said is that before me, lies an unconscious, immobile, middle aged man, temporarily paralysed. <div id="spacer"></div>
In his house. In his bedroom. On his mattress. <div id="spacer"></div>
This is my duty; to remove the memories of specified people, for whatever reason, with the consent of the host. Using the help of my colleague, we tamper with the minds of others in the dark of the night so logically they awaken in the morning as if nothing had ever taken place, and they had never met that specific person. Prior to the event we, however, send away small printed glossy cards to the recipient’s loved ones, relatives, friends; anyone who had an association to both the host and removed person. <div id="spacer"></div>
We raid our client’s house for snacks and alcohol, the process consumes a significant amount of time and they’ll never know so it doesn’t really matter, right? Today we hit the jackpot. Valentine’s Day just passed and this guy seemingly had plans that didn’t go down too well. Well, when he wakes, I guess we’re doing him a favour by detonating all the significant feelings linked to these expensive delicacies. <div id="spacer"></div>
<i>Jesse</i><div id="spacer"></div>
"Sarah just leave it! I told you I’m sorry, get over it! See, the problem with you is that you cannot get over yourself, you are never content are you?” <div id="spacer"></div>
Her bright red hair is so fake, it’s disgusting, why does she have to dye it so much? It feels like a dead cat. The month before she went blue, she explains to me she likes to express herself that way, all she does to express her feelings is bombard me with sarcastic comments and heated lectures. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Jesse, no, you know what? No, you treat me like I am nothing to you. You say all these things and then apologise the next day; I believed it the first 5 times, but you just keep doing all the same things you said you were sorry for! I just-" <div id="spacer"></div>
Muffled sounds but I cannot decipher what she is trying to say. I peer up towards the sky. <div id="spacer"></div>
Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. <div id="spacer"></div>
I try to find her eyes again; ready to hop back into the ring, Jesse in one corner, Sarah in the other. <div id="spacer"></div>
Wait, what colour were her eyes again? I think my eye sight is deteriorating. What is happening? Was her hair green this month? No purple, or was it hot pink? Hold on, where did she go? <div id="spacer"></div>
I try to call for her name but all I feel is emptiness. <div id="spacer"></div>
What was her name? <div id="spacer"></div>
Everything around me fades to black, the fluorescent city lights flicker out, and the blaring horns of passing cars are muted. My surroundings melt as if a bucket of water has splashed an oil-painting. I hear voices, a woman’s and a man’s voice. I close my eyes to escape this chaotic setting. What is this tingling sensation? Where is- where is that girl? <div id="spacer"></div>
Eyes open, the smooth, cold leather of the couch is what I feel first. I grip the cushions for a sense of relief and assurance. <div id="spacer"></div>
"S-SARAH?” I call out. <div id="spacer"></div>
Yes! That’s her name! <div id="spacer"></div>
 She peers through the doorway from the kitchen, then her striking smile appears and she chuckles. Slowly, she waltzes in, calm and bubbly and beautiful. The summer sunlight beams on her soft pale skin and she obtains a gorgeous glow. Just moments ago, I had the urge to shout at the top of my lungs and now-now I-I’m speechless. I gesture for her hand and she pretends to think about it, so I gently pull her towards me and we engage in a warm embrace. I turn to her, staring deeply into her emerald green eyes, <div id="spacer"></div>
"I-S-Sarah, I love y-" <div id="spacer"></div>
Then the couch dissolves, however we were still in the same position, cuddling. I cannot move my limbs. My eyes bounce around in their sockets, hesitating; Sarah is fixed in her smile. Somehow, I manage to control my left hand to hold onto hers, but there is a growing force between us, it’s pushing us away from each other, as if two magnets forced to connect together via incorrect terminals. <div id="spacer"></div>
No, please, let me stay here, leave me, I want this memory, let me keep it; let me keep her, Please! Please just stop this! <div id="spacer"></div>
<i>Reece</i><div id="spacer"></div>
I pour Amelia another glass and we begin on a second round of chocolate Russian roulette. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Hmm, this is strange…” Amelia exclaimed, beginning to become a tad bit tipsy. <div id="spacer"></div>
With a glass in her hand she sneaks another sip of her Shiraz and I check her screen. I gape in confusion. <div id="spacer"></div>
"What are you doing? That’s not the right process,” I said. <div id="spacer"></div>
"He’s…He’s resisting.” <div id="spacer"></div>
"Wait no, impossible, we’ve removed about a dozen of his memories from the past six months, how can he start resisting now?” <div id="spacer"></div>
"Well I don’t know but we can’t let him win this battle.” She says overenthusiastically. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Amelia, I concur we call Cal. He may be able to assist us with this difficulty.” <div id="spacer"></div> 
"Sure, give him a quick call, Cal’s a dedicated, hardworking man, he won’t mind, I’m sure.” Replied Amelia with the greatest grin on her face for no apparent reason. <div id="spacer"></div>
I brush off her exaggerated enthusiasm and rationally decide to ring up Cal, despite the fact that it was probably the alcohol responding, rather than Amelia herself.  <div id="spacer"></div>
<i>Cal</i><div id="spacer"></div>
"Yup, okay, right. Have you tried-oh, I see,” I answered Reece. "Yes, this is a rare predicament indeed…Follow through with the initial processes, I’ll be over in a tick.” <div id="spacer"></div>
The phone sounds as I end the call. Susan stirs and awakens, squinting to the dim light of the lamp. She groans and adjusts herself. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Work?” She says wearily. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Yeah…sorry to wake you honey, go back to sleep.” I whisper, leaning in to peck her on the forehead. "If anything’s wrong just come over, ok?” I part the sheets away from myself and reluctantly head towards the closet. <div id="spacer"></div>
<i>Amelia</i><div id="spacer"></div>
"He’s on his way.” Reece said wide eyed. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Wait, WHAT?” I replied, frightened. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Cal is coming over to check this all out. Amelia, he doesn’t know we do this to our patients, and we’ve totally trashed his place!” He said with panic in his body language. <div id="spacer"></div>
This thought took me time to process but when the realisation did slap me in the face, we spent the next few minutes frantically renewing the room by memory to its previous state. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Hello? Amelia? Reece? It’s Cal.” <div id="spacer"></div>
Our heads rise from our kneeling position like that of two curious meerkats. I neaten up myself and rehearse a professional smile. My head is throbbing from thinking too hard with alcohol in my blood.  <div id="spacer"></div>
The door’s hinges creak. There stood before me Cal. It’s the middle of the night and this fine man still manages to maintain his composure. In a grey suit grasping a leather suitcase, he steps into the house, analysing his setting. Everything he does is so admirable. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Okay, so Mr Rogers is struggling against the treatment? Let me investigate further into this.” Cal wonders over to Mr Rogers and notices his eyes are slightly open, however within seconds they shut again. "This is very strange…” Cal mutters to himself. <div id="spacer"></div>
I head to take a seat at the programmer. Reece decides to head outside for a smoke and some fresh air. Ironic huh? Cal lists a series of commands and gradually I recognise his variation. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Genius…” I think to myself. <div id="spacer"></div>
"…and finally, add another command identical to the first. Voila, everything is again controlled.” <div id="spacer"></div>
I begin to blush without the intention to. <div id="spacer"></div>
"You know Dr Levi, I’ve been reading for leisure quite a bit and I recently stumbled across a handful of philosophical quotes that have really hit me.” I say shying away from him. For example, what JK Rowling stated in one of the Harry Potter’s; "Thoughts could leave deeper scars than almost anything else.” <div id="spacer"></div>
"Hmm… that is very true,” He says, skimming some papers. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Or one of my favourites, by June Ahern; "How hurtful it can be…” I begin, in the process, my peripheral vision glimpses Cal glancing outside of his reading glasses towards my direction. <div id="spacer"></div>
I continue, however he recites it alongside, "How hurtful it can be to deny one's true self and live a life of lies just to appease others.” <div id="spacer"></div>
"You know of her?” I ask, turning to face him. <div id="spacer"></div>
"I certainly do.” <div id="spacer"></div>
I smile and fiddle with the pen in my hands. "You know Dr Levi, in the Truth about Forever; Sarah Dessen explains that "There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a heartbeat, in a-<div id="spacer"></div>
"-single, flashing, throbbing moment.” He pauses. Then an impulse in my body drives me forward. <div id="spacer"></div>
We kiss, but almost instantly he pulls away. <div id="spacer"></div>
What have I done? <div id="spacer"></div>
A flush of embarrassment first and I avoid eye contact. <div id="spacer"></div>
"I-I’m-" <div id="spacer"></div>
No words are exchanged before he quickly pulls me forward again. <div id="spacer"></div>
<i>Jesse</i><div id="spacer"></div>
Hey, I remember this. This was our first month anniversary. We headed to the diner down the street. Yeah, not that fancy, but it was such a beautiful night. The air was warm and it was a crisp autumn. I remember she appeared stunning, I felt like the luckiest guy on Earth. Me an introvert finding her; made me believe in miracles. <div id="spacer"></div>
Wait, no. No, no not again. No please! Please I beg of you! PLEASE! <div id="spacer"></div>
<i>Reece</i><div id="spacer"></div>
Tonight is nice. It’s not cold, or humid, or beautiful or horrible, it’s just, nice. I peer into the dark depths of the sky, the hot balls of gases twinkle. I’m not quite sure how, but I feel the moonlight on me. <div id="spacer"></div>
I gaze up at the room where Dr Levi and Amelia are situated. I realise what is happening, but I’m not too worried right now, everything is just so perfect at this very moment. This was inevitable in my opinion, like she said herself, it was fate. <div id="spacer"></div>
I retrieve my jacket from the van as the night grows cooler. <div id="spacer"></div>
<i>Susan</i><div id="spacer"></div>
Sammy’s awake. Infants are so problematic. He says he’s not sleeping until he obtains "Mr MooMoo” which is a stuffed monkey. The difficulty is that Mr MooMoo is in Cal’s car. I guess I don’t have a choice, Sammy is causing a ruckus. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Sandra! Keep an eye on Sammy please, I’ll be out for a bit, all you’re doing is watching late night Television any who.” <div id="spacer"></div>
"Whatever mum…” She responds in her adolescent dialect. <div id="spacer"></div>
<i>Reece</i><div id="spacer"></div>
I’m almost finished with this stick. I hear the sound of an engine in the distance, strange, who would be pulling up on this street at this time? <div id="spacer"></div>
Then I see her car. An instant terror consumes me. This would break her; I open the van door and begin to honk the horn hoping they catch my memo. She parks on the driveway and sights me blaring. Soon she realises what is going on. Her expression shatters me. A lump in my throat develops and I cannot construct words. Amelia and Cal break from their doing and Cal stands there in dismay. Amelia bolts down the stairs and out the front door, her eyes swelling with tears. <div id="spacer"></div>
And now the night isn’t so nice. <div id="spacer"></div>
<i>Amelia</i><div id="spacer"></div>
"Mrs Levi! Please, this is a misunderstanding! I forced myself onto him! He was pressured! I’m so sorry,” I find it hard to swallow while crying and I choke on my words. <div id="spacer"></div>
"GET AWAY FROM ME.” She screams hopping back into her driver’s seat. She starts the engine and glares at me, her eyes glistening, holding in what I would imagine anger, disappointment, sadness, all at once. <div id="spacer"></div>
"Please Mrs Levi he had nothing to do with this!” <div id="spacer"></div>
With the window wound down she clutches my wrist, "Stop kidding yourself Amelia, you can have him,” Susan pauses and begins the early stages of hyperventilation, the tears stream down her cheeks; "You did once upon a time.”
