            <div id="story-text">
There was a man who appeared to those who saw him to be in his mid-20’s. His name was Jabihiga Tulangu Bahibii Hibayugga, but people just called him Jabby. He was the stereotypical Samoan living in Woodridge - always starting a street brawl, carjacking, robbing houses and stealing food from Woolies. His date of birth was unknown as his parents didn’t have a grasp of the concept of time, but we do know that he was born in the back seat of a van in an alleyway. <div id="spacer"></div>
On this night, he had just brushed his teeth with a paintbrush and went into his bed (aka the towel on the floor). He was about to fall asleep…<div id="spacer"></div>
BAM! A quartet of Logan Bogans broke into Jabby’s house. Jabby slipped out of his towel and went to open his closet where he had a baseball bat (made of LEGO).  Jabby saw the Logan Bogans going to his mother’s room. He ran up to them, and hit one in the back of the head with the bat. The LEGO bat broke apart and the Bogan punched Jabby in the face, knocking him out. <div id="spacer"></div>
Jabby woke up in the police station facing a man who said “Jabihiga, I would like to interview you. What do you remember happening last night?” <div id="spacer"></div>
“A bunch of Logan Bogans broke into mah house so I got da bat and smack one but he knock me out and now I’ma here”. <div id="spacer"></div>
“I have bad news. All of your money has been stolen.” said the man. <div id="spacer"></div>
 “NO! I spent the past two years saving up! I didn’t even get past $5.60!” said Jabby. <div id="spacer"></div>
  The man was about to bring up something even more disturbing. <div id="spacer"></div>
 “But, I have even worse news. We found your mother unconscious in her room, her heart wasn’t beating. Briefly she opened her eyes, and said “The fat boy is adopted.” Then she was pronounced dead for 12 seconds, but she woke up and strangled our medic. Then she finally died alongside the medic.” <div id="spacer"></div>
Jabby ran to the corner to cry for about 25 minutes. He considered stopping but decided that he needed another hour of flooding the floor. When he was done, the man told him, “We have gathered fingerprint evidence and believe that the people who killed your mother were members of the Browns Plains Logan Bogan Empire (BPLBE). You may leave now.” <div id="spacer"></div>
Leaving the police station, Jabby was about to do something he didn’t want to. He was going to meet a rich white boy. Now, Jabby didn’t like rich white boys. He got really jealous that they were rich. Sometimes he theorised that rich white boys are rich because they are white. <div id="spacer"></div>
This rich white boy’s name was Jacob Maxwell. Jacob was a scientist who had done some pretty mad experiments like the diarrhoea cannon, injecting tree DNA into hippies, breeding a hybrid pig-snake that sheds its skin (which is actually meat) once a week for infinite bacon. <div id="spacer"></div>
“Bruuu I need yo help man,” said Jabby<div id="spacer"></div>
Jacob replied “Yes, what would you need?” <div id="spacer"></div>
“Deh Logan Bogans from dah BPLBE killed mah Mum and I want to get revenge.” <div id="spacer"></div>
 “Only in Browns Plains… Okay Jabby, I am occupied in my research on curing super cancer and hacking into Area 51, but I’m a rich white boy, so you can have $9,532,215.” <div id="spacer"></div>

“Bruuu I did not know numbers could go that high, I’ve never even held $10!” <div id="spacer"></div>
“Use the money well” said Jacob. <div id="spacer"></div>
Jabby’s plan was to run to the local gun shop to buy a gun, threaten the owner then rob the entire store, but nothing is easy in a suburb of intense gang-warfare. <div id="spacer"></div>
On the way, Jabby was confronted by seven Aboriginal gangsters who yelled “Bro get out of here. This is our territory! Go back to climbing trees” <div id="spacer"></div>
 Jabby was about to put his history of working out to the test, so he ran up to them and rammed them with his face while waving his arms around like the people in Wii commercials. <div id="spacer"></div>
He managed a hit at all of them, but they weren’t down yet. The Aborigines circled around him and all tackled him to the ground (The joke was on them because Jabby thought concrete tasted good). However, because of Jabby’s strength, he got himself back up and punched every single one in the face. <div id="spacer"></div>
The battle didn’t end there, the Aborigines held hands and morphed into one giant super Aborigine. But Jabby had a strategy; he ran away, snared a white boy and chucked him at the Super Aborigine. It divided into 7 again and finally, all were knocked out. <div id="spacer"></div>
With that accomplished, Jabby entered the gun store. <div id="spacer"></div>
“Bruu I won buy dah RPG with every attachment from Call of Duty - with ammo bruu.” <div id="spacer"></div>
The shop owner replied “That will be $3000.” <div id="spacer"></div>
Jabby handed over the money, got his gun and pointed it at the shop owner. Threatening him with a Rocket Launcher, Jabby robbed the entire store of its guns, ammo and money. <div id="spacer"></div>
Jabby began to plan his attack as he knew that if he went without a disguise, the cops would come to his house to arrest him. So he created a costume, just like Aquaman’s, and a new name, Woodridge Warrior! <div id="spacer"></div>
Jabby drove to Browns Plains in a Hummer that he totally did not steal. He approached the BPLBE tower, ran inside and started shooting everybody. Pretty much everyone died except the leader who was at the top of the building (30th floor), so he ran up there. <div id="spacer"></div>
“Oi, why did you kill all my guys? I spent hours memorising all their names!” said the leader. The leader was wearing a cloak, not showing his face, until Jabby yelled, “SHOW YO FACE WHTE BOY!” Slowly, the leader took his cloak off. <div id="spacer"></div>
After being kicked out of the Government for his incompetence, it appeared that the leader of the BPLBE was Tony Abbott! <div id="spacer"></div>
“Muahahaha-UGH!” Jabby shot Tony in the face, pulled a bunch of bombs from his backpack, activated the five second timer and jumped out the window. <div id="spacer"></div>
As the building exploded, Jabby fell to the ground, flapping his arms in a futile attempt to save himself. Thus, Jabby died a hero, having defeated the BPLBE and their evil leader. For ever after, everyone remembered him as the guy who had repeatedly robbed their houses, as having a baseball bat made of Lego, as being poor and not knowing how to operate an escalator. As you can see, he was a very respected man. <div id="spacer"></div>
The end.
