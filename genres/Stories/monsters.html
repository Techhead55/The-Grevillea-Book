<i>Is it possible to kill the monster inside of you, without killing yourself? If it is, please let me know.</i><div id="spacer"></div>
-:-:-
7 attempts. <div id="spacer"></div>
The number of times I have tried to escape from this world. <div id="spacer"></div>
20 months. <div id="spacer"></div>
The time that I have held hostage by a monster called depression. <div id="spacer"></div>
And over 100’s of scars. <div id="spacer"></div>
The faded marks left behind by the sharp pieces of metal. Marks that show the battle fought. Marks… that show my story. <div id="spacer"></div>
Knowing that I may not survive until the morning is haunting, but almost satisfying at the same time. I would take any excuse to escape from this hell hole. This place people called home. But I know that my real home is elsewhere. <div id="spacer"></div>
Blood trickles down my wrists and legs, making a beautiful painting, made only of red. It’s a familiar sight, only this time the canvas is made up of the sharp rocky surface that lays beneath my bare feet. <div id="spacer"></div>
I give the area a quick glance over; looking for anyone is may be here to witness my great stunt. But to my luck, there was no one. So I was left to myself, where my scars haunt me and my thoughts kill me. I thought back to just this morning, when my best friends was trying to convince me not to kill myself. It scared me, that I would be leaving all the people I love, because of those monsters. The monsters that ruin my life. Most people in the class don’t know about me. Some don’t even know my name. And some, are the ones that keep me going. <div id="spacer"></div>
I quickly pulled on my sweater, as I could feel a chilly night set in. I pull a tear-stained note out from the pocket on my sweater, rubbing it between my fingers, before opening it to read it for the very last time. <div id="spacer"></div>
Re-reading this death letter has created many more tear-stains on the fragile piece of paper. I hold the piece of paper tightly in my hand, hoping that when they recover my body, someone will pass it on to my family. I close my eyes, and take a large step closer towards the edge of cliff. I hear a few stray chunks of the earth slide down the side of this rocky surface, letting me know that the next step I take will be my death step. <div id="spacer"></div>
I’m about to take my next step, my step to freedom... until I feel an arm wrap around my small waist. A waist that could have only been created by hours of starving and purging. This strange person pulls me away from the cliff edge, letting my bare feet drag along the green grass that sits behind the dead  surface. <div id="spacer"></div>
I open my eyes to come face to face with a blonde haired boy, with blue eyes, and salty tear trails over his pale cheeks. <div id="spacer"></div>
Unexpectedly, I feel his arms wrapped around my small figure, and naturally my arms lift up to wrap around his waist as well. <div id="spacer"></div>
We stand on this green meadow for what seems like hours, enjoying this warm cuddle. One that warms us both on this freezing winter’s night. He pulls away from the comforting hug, and leads me towards an old, rusty bench that sits just a few metres form the cliff edge. I hesitate for a moment, but I couldn’t resist the thought of having someone that cares. <div id="spacer"></div>
We sit there for a moment in silence, because I’m too scared to say something, and I’m sure the boy has too many questions. <div id="spacer"></div>
“I’m sure so many people care about you. Why would you want to take your life?” The boy questions me. I’m not sure whether or not to reply to this stranger, but I can’t help but feel a sense of care in his voice. <div id="spacer"></div>
“No one likes me. Except for my two best friends but-“<div id="spacer"></div>
“Then shouldn’t you try to fight through this, for them. You may not realise it, but not everyone hates you” boy shouted at me. I instantly felt a sense of hate, but this hate changed into something else. One that I can’t exactly put a name on. But whatever it was, it changed me, because I could feel it in the pit of my stomach. <div id="spacer"></div>
“Why are you here anyway?” It’s not every day that someone takes a stroll near this death trap. I only just found this place a few days ago, hidden amongst thick bushes and a busy high way. <div id="spacer"></div>
I could see the boy’s face drop when the words left my mouth. <div id="spacer"></div>
“I’m Emily by the way”. The words burst out of my mouth before I could stop them. <div id="spacer"></div>
“I’m Noah”. <div id="spacer"></div>
An awkward silence was created between us for several minutes, until he broke our invisible tension. <div id="spacer"></div>
“More people care about you than you actually think. I know...  because I think the exact same thing.” <div id="spacer"></div>
He started fiddling around with the zipped on his jumper that blankets him from the cool winds. <div id="spacer"></div>
And once the green cloth lost contact from his hand, a look of shame spread across his face. <div id="spacer"></div>
And scars and cuts spread across his wrists. His jumper must have absorbed most of the blood, but small red specks remained on his wounds. His battle wounds. <div id="spacer"></div>
I pulled my sweater off me as well, and I was just standing there in the cool wind in nothing but my long jeans and a sleeveless shirt. <div id="spacer"></div>
Once again, we just sit in silence for a while, trying to make sense of what is happening. <div id="spacer"></div>
He picked up my small hands in his, and just stared at my bare fingernails for several minutes, until he turned over my hands to examine my wrists. Some of the cuts were stilling bleeding; even after 30 minutes, but most of them had dried up, leaving behind specks just like the ones that covered the boy’s cuts. <div id="spacer"></div>
I could feel tears welling up in my eyes, but I was determined to not let any of them roll down my face. I quickly wiped away a few that were on the verge of falling, and when I looked up again, the boy stared straight into my eyes. And this time, I couldn’t keep in my salty water drops. <div id="spacer"></div>
I burst into tears, not knowing what else to do. <div id="spacer"></div>
I quickly pulled my hands out of the boys, and struggled to pull on my sweater. The boy started talking, but I couldn’t bear the thought of being stopped again. I got off the rusty bench and started walking really fast back to where I was originally positioned. <div id="spacer"></div>
I could hear a pair of feet coming towards me. Ones that I could never out run. <div id="spacer"></div>
There was only one exit from this boy, from this world. To jump. <div id="spacer"></div>
I reached the edge of the cliff. I’m about to jump, when I feel the boys hand slide into mine. <div id="spacer"></div>
I look up at him, and see him give a small nod to me. <div id="spacer"></div>
“I’m coming with you”. <div id="spacer"></div>
I could see tears pool in his eyes as well. He held my hand up to his face, and planted a small kiss on the back of my hand. <div id="spacer"></div>
I held him tight, and let myself love someone one last time. One last time, before we jumped. <div id="spacer"></div>
